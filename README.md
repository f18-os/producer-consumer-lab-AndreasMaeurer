# Per Dr. Freudenthal's email I tried implementing pieces of the lab with integers before doing the actual lab.

# The file FirstPieceOfPcLab.py implements one producer that produces integers from one to 20 and one consumer that prints the integers

# The file SecondPieceOfPcLab.py implements one producer (20 integers again), one processor (adds 1000 to each one), and one consumer (prints to screen)

# The file ExtractAndDisplayWithMoreComments.py is the given code just with more comments that I wrote to help me understand what the code does

# I have a readme and a collaboration file

## The file actualProdConsLab.py implements the actual lab.

# The given Lab Instructions:

# Producer Consumer Lab

For this lab you will implement a trivial producer-consumer system using
python threads where all coordination is managed by counting and binary
semaphores for a system of two producers and two consumers. The producers and
consumers will form a simple rendering pipeline using multiple threads. One
thread will read frames from a file, a second thread will take those frames
and convert them to grayscale, and the third thread will display those
frames. The threads will run concurrently.

## File List
### ExtractFrames.py
Extracts a series of frames from the video contained in 'clip.mp4' and saves 
them as jpeg images in sequentially numbered files with the pattern
'frame_xxxx.jpg'.

### ConvertToGrayscale.py
Loads a series for frams from sequentially numbered files with the pattern
'frame_xxxx.jpg', converts the grames to grayscale, and saves them as jpeg
images with the file names 'grayscale_xxxx.jpg'

### DisplayFrames.py
Loads a series of frames sequently from files with the names
'grayscale_xxxx.jpg' and displays them with a 42ms delay.

### ExtractAndDisplay.py
Loads a series of frames from a video contained in 'clip.mp4' and displays 
them with a 42ms delay

## Requirements
* Extract frames from a video file, convert them to grayscale, and display
them in sequence
* You must have three functions
  * One function to extract the frames
  * One function to convert the frames to grayscale
  * One function to display the frames at the original framerate (24fps)
* The functions must each execute within their own python thread
  * The threads will execute concurrently
  * The order threads execute in may not be the same from run to run
* Threads will need to signal that they have completed their task
* Threads must process all frames of the video exactly once
* Frames will be communicated between threads using producer/consumer idioms
  * Producer/consumer quesues will be bounded at ten frames

Note: You may have ancillary objects and method in order to make you're code easer to understand and implement.
